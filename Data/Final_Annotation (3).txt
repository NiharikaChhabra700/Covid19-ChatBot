0	@PKBurian @PHE_uk Where is that data published ?
1	Sorry to sound like a broken record, but post Covid syndromes are real. Add to that the new delta variant, and the risk of unvaccinated people getting COVID and long term syndromes is REAL. GET VACCINATED https://t.co/C8EMEyEas1
1	5/n An international subgroup, specifically focused on SARS-C2-Delta, might be what is needed next. I'll post what I know over the next few weeks, but this is the next emerging threat.
1	4/n Do we need a booster for SARS-C2-Delta in the winter ? In what populations ? Do the newer vaccines need to be a cocktail containing at least some activity against SARS-C2-Delta?
1	3/n Do vaccinated people (which vaccine?) have milder disease and fewer deaths/hospitalizations?
1	2/n What do we know about the "real world" effectiveness of the current vaccines against this variant? How many fully vaccinated people got SARS-C2-Delta after being fully vaccinated?
1	1/n It might be an interesting idea to create a SUBGROUP of researchers to study the B1617 (Delta) SARS-Cov2 variant that dominated the Indian wave of the pandemic and caused such enormous lethality
1	Here's more evidence to prove the hypothesis that we've been advancing over several months https://t.co/PJRrRXfwe8

0	@tegel35574003 And lots and lots of underreporting !
1	@tegel35574003 Done already. Nothing's changed. Occham's patchwork remains: in India's case, poor policy decisions (complacency); possible new strain (no prior immunity); and a younger age (partially protective).
1	And yes, please please get vaccinated. This is not an anti-vaccination manifesto. Quite the opposite: GET VACCINATED. WEAR MASKS. ISOLATE. But also, let's get real world data now, for India, and for the world.
1	I got a thousand replies to my questions, but not any that I needed/wanted. 1. I know the lab data... do we have HUMAN data on AZ/Covaxin vaccine effectiveness against B1618 etc in India? 2. And why aren't any of these studies in PEER REVIEWED JOURNALS?
1	If only this was done systematically with some Control group of doctors (or others)... but it’s a start https://t.co/IL4bgh1EMG
1	19/n I know it’s easy to opine from far away, but I’ve taken care of Covid patients. Follow @PSampathkumarMD and @Atul_Gawande who give good clear advice.
1	18/n If the situation worsens (how can it worsen?), contemplate a 2 week nationwide lockdown AS A LAST RESORT. Plan in that case to provide human services to migrants PROSPECTIVELY, again by appointing a commission NOW, not after
1	17/n STAY AT HOME; wear a mask. Isolate. Do not attend crowded places (rallies or melas) with poor ventilation.
1	16/n The three pillars of response (oxygen supply chain /hospital logistics and vaccine virology and distribution) should be meeting EVERY OTHER DAY to provide live and realistic data outputs so that we can understand the evolving nature of the pandemic
1	6. Open green lanes for ambulances to bring people to the hospital that need more acute and urgent care.    7. Waive the requirement for “ prior Covid test” to admit critically ill patients. Bayesian statistics would argue that these people have covid.
1	5. Create field hospitals where oxygen sats can be checked and lower level Covid care (as above can be administered). Remember how during the Spanish flu pandemic, field hospitals were set up outside.
1	3. Transport oxygen by airlift or train if possible. Start refitting industrial plants for medical oxygen.     4. Rely on other countries to stopgap while the supplies are low. Release customs barriers ASAP.
1	14/n So overall suggestions  1. Release data or appoint from a clinical body to assess the reality of viral breakthrough after vaccination     2. Release data about oxygen supply chain problem and appoint a commission to solve it ASAP.
1	13/n If oxygen saturation falls below that, go to hospital in  an ambulance that has a working oxygen tank. Prone position. Fluids. Oxygen. Dexamethasone. Remdesivir and Toci only under medical supervision (does not reduce deaths in severe Covid).
1	12/n 1. If Oxygen sat above 92 percent, stay home, use fever medicines, lie prone, drink water and use Budesonide inhalers (small study).   2. Do NOT crowd hospitals.
1	11/n Are there field hospitals being set up ? If so, would people be comfortable with the army corps being deployed to manage them ? The requirements for mild/moderate Covid are simple ...
1	10/n The GOI keeps telling us it’s under control. But the testimonies of people tell us a completely opposite story. Can one get the real data ? Where ? Is there a plan ? Who is making the plan, and under what situation?
1	9/n Turning away from virology, where does one get an assessment of the oxygen situation in the worst affected States ?
1	8/n And what do we know about the virulence of B1617. B117 (UK variant) is clearly more pathogenic— although protected by vaccination. One would expect B1617 to also be more infectious and virulent. Any real (human) data ?
1	7/n In Israel, a SMALL study suggests that the Pfizer vaccine protects against B 1617. We KNOW it protects against B117. But what about AZ and Covaxin ? Do they protect ?
1	6/n Last two questions from the virological point of view. In vitro evidence suggests that the B117 and B1617 strains (dominant in India) can be neutralized with the vaccines.
1	5/n Also crucial to know if vaccines reduce hospitalization or severity. Is there an inoculum dose response ? And is there a critical time post vaccine that full immunity kicks in ?
0	4/n Such a study should be relatively easy to launch — I’d be happy to contribute thoughts on study design @AskDrShashank or others.
1	3/n Or the true effectiveness of the vaccines in the field are substantially lower. In which case, we need to measure that... it’s crucial to drive policy
1	1/n The anecdotal stories about the number of people in India getting COVID after AZ or Covaxin need to be addressed.
1	This is an example of a crowdsourced survey of real world protection from Covid by the vaccine. Not the strongest data, but at least an impression of what might be real. Please encourage folks to fill it out. It's essential to see if vaccines are effective https://t.co/4JoG3S8xNV
1	@EricTopol I know the Israel data on B1617. The question is whether AZ or Covaxin have any real world (or randomized trial) data. Otherwise, need a major change in direction of containment of India's pandemic.
1	This is a perfect study for a global alliance (including WHO) to launch. We really, really need to establish whether the two vaccines in India (Covaxin and Covishield/AZ) are effective. Do they protect against severe disease? It would take a month to do the study..
0	All the data thus far seem to be either anecdotal or lab-based (in vitro assays). There must be someone doing a human study? Any published data ?
1	Is there any evidence in humans that either the Indian strain is more pathogenic or infectious ? Or that AZ is protective ? I know the lab data.
1	2/n another one is https://t.co/rCyN0t9A1e
1	1/n lots of people have been asking about where to donate for Covid in India. I haven’t vetted any organization. But I’ll post some resources: 1. CDDEP is working on providing medical oxygen. It's easy to donate on this link, especially if you live abroad.https://t.co/Bz0EkAcBeA
0	Again full disclosure: I founded $VOR, and my conflicts are disclosed and public. These are model studies; I’m excited and await human trials against a deadly disease.

0	What would it take to make this image viral ? https://t.co/OBYxIgPBb4
1	@ajumathew_ @muradbanaji @KurtadikarKetan @EricTopol @antonystanley09 Yup. I thought so. The B16.17 frequency was low back in March. And we know that AZ likely works on B117. So the anxiety remains ...
1	4/n “Perhaps any analysis would prove premature. If new viral strains [...]were to sweep through every prediction of mortality might be overturned [...] the pandemic is far from over.
1	3/n “ Was the “demographic structure” of a population the real factor? Were the disparities exaggerated by undercounting, with shoddy reporting systems? Was government response a critical variable?”
1	2/n As I had pointed out in the New Yorker, many potential factors, and still a mystery ...  1. Massive public rallies with no masks and no distancing   2. Continuous undercounting   3. New strain (still under investigation)
1	1/n Lots of folks asking about India’s devastating second wave after it had seemingly escaped the worst of the first...
1	@ajumathew_ @muradbanaji @KurtadikarKetan @EricTopol Do you know the B16.17 variant frequency in ernakulum ?
1	My mom !!! A covid hero... ventured out by herself and is vaccinated https://t.co/fvS7RFIXOd
0	Also worth emphasizing that T cell immunity remains unimpacted. https://t.co/vTgcDfW1T3
0	@HenrikVogt @EricTopol Also worth emphasizing that T cell immunity remains un impacted.
1	@muradbanaji @ajumathew_ @KurtadikarKetan @EricTopol This was a mix of AZ and covaxin ?
1	Wear Masks!!!!
0	@ajumathew_ @EricTopol What does this show ?
1	@EricTopol and others: Do we have data that the AZ vaccine is effective against the Indian variant ? Against severe disease ? What about Covaxin? It would be gratifying if AZ was effective (esp against severe dz) given that it’s being widely used in India and sent as relief.
0	1/2 Ok. Phew. A major victory with the US govt today after a week of advocating through multiple channels. Thank you everyone. And thanks to the administration ...https://t.co/gXyofTSmtp.     Now on to the oxygen issue.
0	And now, we can't even THINK of believing the official numbers....https://t.co/t25sUw7o44
0	@71stUSsecretary @POTUS   Please read the below thread...  https://t.co/zj35pm9zyb
0	The full thread is here, if anyone wants it  https://t.co/zj35pm9zyb
1	7/n 4. Vaccine raw materials. The US needs to approve a "waiver" so that vaccine manufacture can continue. Leadership counts. Send letters, pleas, to whoever you know. India manufactures the bulk of vaccine for the world. A vaccine holdup in India has ricocheting consequences.
1	6/n 3. Dexamethasone and inhaled steroids are apparently in supply. But we are checking to see if adequate supplies are available in pharmacies.
1	5/n 2. Military grade oxygen concentrators and refillable tanks. This is one example: https://t.co/UfQNrN43D2
1	4/nThe most immediate requirements are:  1. Liquid oxygen in tanks. The requirement is about 40-50,000 metric tons temporarily. Some of it has been procured from Germany, Japan and the M.East. There is a govt. tender to procure these from any supplier, including ones in the US.
1	3/n Now, let's get practical. I've spoken to several people on the ground in India, and here are the immediate needs in terms of priorities. Several field hospitals are being set up, but there are dire infrastructural needs.
0	2/n This is, or was, a moment of historic importance for the US/ Biden administration to show leadership and solidarity. Recall the legacy of WW2 that established America as a world leader. Compare that to the leadership today.
1	1/n Long thread, but of crucial importance. The COVID-19 situation in India is as dire as can be. And it is not just THEIR problem, as long as virus circulates in the world, it becomes EVERYONE'S problem. We live in a global society; viruses don't respect national borders.

1	3/3 And by the way, "Mississippi (MS) at 37.3% has the second highest rate of adult obesity in the nation preceded by West Virginia (37.7%)". Obesity is a major risk factor for severe COVID.
1	2/2 Drive through sites and complex scheduling are causing bottlenecks. Solve these first...increase PSAs to assure people of safety.. and issue and use vaccine passports to incentivize vaccination.
1	1/2 Vaccine hesitancy is worrisome but inaccessibility is just as problematic. If the B1.1.7 were to tear through Mississippi, as it might, everyone will be bemoaning both. It’s time to address both problems.   https://t.co/et1cC01pns
1	Michigan spread of B1.1.7 deserves a swift response; it will threaten other states. Enforce masks and social distancing, and VACCINATE during lockdown. Other states consider enforcing mandatory quarantines for travelers from Michigan without vaccination or testing. Thoughts?
1	3/3 And here’s an idea. How about allowing vaccine passports — but if you don’t want one, you need to be tested negative within the last 48 hours. And you’ll be charged for every test. Works ?
1	2/3 GET VACCINATED. Other effects include strokes, clots in the lung, cardiac disease, pneumonia (obviously) and DEATH. The B1.1.7 strain is quelled by (most) vaccines, and is rising in every state. I know 40 year old healthy men who have died. Get vaccinated !!!
1	1/3 GET VACCINATED. This Lancet study has some caveats (retrospective) but neurological and psychiatric diseases post Covid are now documented in multiple studies. There is strong evidence for long term effects— this is not “just the flu”   https://t.co/rLjQdcxhqw
0	@95thoughts All of that is AAV. It is a different virus, and we use it in our lab. Adenoviruses and Adeno-associated viruses have different properties.
0	@95thoughts That was with Adeno Associated virus (AAV). Typically Adenovirus vectors do not integrate into DNA. The only exception is high dose infusion into the liver, and there too, the level of integration was minimal.
1	3/3 Why get vaccinated if you are young and healthy ? Because we SUSPECT (but don't know) that you will be protected from the other strains (eg P1), and have mild disease, as opposed to being stuck in a hospital or ICU
1	2/3 Why get vaccinated if you are young and healthy ? Because, if infected, you will transmit the infection to your grandmother and your immunocompromised brother, and harm THEM...
1	1/3 Why get vaccinated if you are young and healthy ?   1. Because the disease caused by B1.1.7 can be severe. The Pfizer vaccine protects (and possibly same for Moderna and J/J). B1.1.7 CAN kill you....even if you feel perfectly healthy now  https://t.co/DujNewMGjZ

1	Part of the answer to my earlier question. The only answer: vaccinate, vaccinate. B117 is 67 percent more lethal. The urgency of getting immunity cannot be emphasized!!  https://t.co/az2SekXn7a
1	Still confused and concerned about the Michigan spike, and would love any perspective on it. New variants? Lack of vaccine penetration? Thoughts ? https://t.co/iydTOZesZL
1	See below on Israel’s success with vaccination. Covid almost vanished; society beginning to function normally. Meanwhile, in USA, we are still struggling to get people vaccinated ... and new, lethal strains are circulating https://t.co/NrMpHakB0W
1	And new viral strains (emerging in India and elsewhere) might turn this whole thing tipsy turbo again. Answer: get vaccinated. Even the “old” vaccines likely protect somewhat against the new strains (T cell immunity; cross reactivity etc)
0	2/2 I consider many hypotheses, including prior immunity. Obesity often brought up, but obesity in Italy is comparable to Lagos State in Nigeria (1/100 death rate). A multitude of factors must be at play

1	2/2 Nicely done. Two more charts with the R0 and likely (note “likely”) decreasing ejected viral inoculum post vaccination (and masking) — less virus out, less virus in — and we might have COVID in 4 crayon charts...@profshanecrotty
1	1/2 @profshanecrotty... GOSH precisely my thoughts on Covid, nicely distilled in a LONG thread by Shane Crotty. He nails it. Only thing I would add is (a) viral inoculum matters (wear masks) and (b) if we drive R0 down at a pop level, we can be optimistic. https://t.co/movugY7bVe
0	2/n Which is like someone who goes on a shooting spree against people and then says that they have a "fear addiction". C'mon, since when is it OK to use "sexual addiction" as a cover for racial hate crime ?
0	1/n And this, from the NYT, is particularly absurd  Investigators said they had not ruled out a racial motive, even as the suspect, a 21-year-old white man..denied being driven by bigotry. He had a “sexual addiction” and saw the spas as an outlet..“that he shouldn’t be doing,”
0	Is anti-Asian racial hatred real ? Yes, absolutely. Why are we not tackling this issue in political circles ? We need to bring this to national attention. We are not "models"; we are real people, making our way through hatred and structural racism.   https://t.co/WR3rZBO0QG
1	Many new strains circulating that cause concern. Vaccination in underserved populations is a HUGE problem. Meanwhile, people cavorting in bars. Please... let's not be cavalier about this.
1	Why on earth are we pretending that the pandemic is over? It is not. We need to vaccinate, vaccinate, and continue precautionary measures. Europe is experiencing a THIRD wave. Please... let's be thoughtful.
0	5/n And genetics, also, cannot be the only answer. An African-American had a manyfold chance of dying compared to an African living in the continent (recognizing many regional differences). Same with Indians in the UK vs Indians in India.
0	4/n And so the answer brings us back to the multifactorial nature of the problem. It could be obesity in particular age groups, compounded by the population pyramid, and perhaps, by other hypotheses.
0	3/n Comparably, both Italy and France have similar rates of obesity and overweight individuals. Yet the death rates in Italy and France far outweigh the rates in Lagos state, and in Nigeria in general.
0	2/n But while this may be a variable, it cannot be the only one. Below are the data on obesity from Lagos state, the largest in Nigeria of overweight and obese people. https://t.co/i3ULx0LymG

1	My mother got vaccinated today. Oh what a HUGE relief. She’s still going to mask and keep social distance, but it’s the most personal sign of light at the end of this tunnel...
0	2/2 Obesity may play a role but the obesity rate in Italy (lots of deaths) is not high. Genetics also unlikely because African Americans disproportionately affected in US, while genetically similar Africans relatively unaffected (except https://t.co/CdreaJxxwI).

1	6/n If a vaccine resistant strain arises, we are looking at another 500K deaths. It is a crucial time. 5. We need to have a good test for the variants. Get researchers to find PCR primers to detect the variants. There isn't time to lose.
1	5/n 4. The negative PCR test must be repeated 4 days after entry. There will still be leakage, but we can Whackamole those.

1	3/n I cannot see any way forward except: 1. detect the frequency of the variants in the USA and isolate and confine them.
1	2/n The London variant is more contagious. The Manaus and South African variants may -- MAY -- cause repeat infections.
1	1/n Please pay attention, please. I'm afraid that we are falling behind in this COVID race. There are at least 4 variants of concern: variants arising in London, Manaus, Japan and South Africa.

1	Catching COVID-19 (or any virus) is nobody’s “fault” &amp; it is greatly harmful to blame individual people for contracting an infectious disease.

1	Excellent thread from my co-author Dr. @MichaelWorobey, explaining his reasoning that a zoonotic origin for SARS-CoV-2 is most likely. I agree.

1	@OldCrabDesign @awalkerinLA @NEJM That's incorrect. Vaccine effectiveness is measured by protection against developing COVID-19, not being infected with SARS-CoV-2. No vaccine provides 100% protection against either infection or disease. In this case, the majority of infections in vaccinated ppl are asymptomatic.

1	It's also an argument against "pre-adaptation," or the idea that SARS-CoV-2 was already adapted to a human host when it emerged. The original FCS is very clearly suboptimal and the emergence of convergent mutants (alpha also has a mutation at P681) suggesting no "pre-adaptation."
1	After SARS-CoV-2 spike binds ACE2 and enters a cell to begin the infection process, it's taken up into a specialized membrane-bound compartment called an endosome. There, spike is cleaved and this allows the fusion peptide to fuse with the endosomal membrane.  h/t @ConversationEDU https://t.co/6OsEMFa4fC

1	It also explains breakthrough infections. No vaccine is perfect, and a high enough dose of virus can overcome vaccine-induced defenses enough to cause an infection, though vaccine-induced immunity will limit disease severity in most cases.
1	But fully vaccinated people have high titers of neutralizing antibodies and mature memory B and T cell responses. It's a lot harder for delta to overwhelm these defenses by just throwing more virus at them.
1	Unvaccinated people have no defense against delta. It's easy for delta to gain a foothold with higher exposure.    Partially vaccinated people have low levels of neutralizing antibodies. It's easy for delta to overcome the antibodies they do have just by strength in numbers.
1	Unvaccinated people are most vulnerable.    Partially vaccinated people are slightly less vulnerable but not robustly protected.    Fully vaccinated people are very protected.
1	This study suggests that the mechanism behind delta's increased transmissibility is just that there's a lot more of it, sooner. If there's more virus around, it's going to be easier to spread.     This is also consistent with the vaccine data that's been reported for delta.
0	@JoshuaDHunter Yes. I've gone out a couple times and sat outdoors on every occasion, despite everyone in my group being fully vaccinated.
1	But please don't worry excessively about breakthrough infections. The data doesn't suggest that we should. The greatest risk continues to be in unvaccinated people.     Please, consider getting vaccinated if you aren't already. They are how we end the pandemic for good.
1	I am continuing to mask out of caution and concern for my community, not because I am worried about breakthrough infection. Though I don't enjoy wearing a mask, masking comes at a low cost to me &amp; at minimum it's courteous to do while SARS-CoV-2 still circulates in my community.
1	So the moral of the story is get vaccinated. If you are really worried about breakthrough &amp; want to be extra cautious, consider adding other interventions (masks, distancing, ventilation, etc). I am continuing to wear masks in indoor public spaces, although #VaccinesWork.
1	If a vaccinated person is exposed &amp; infected, the rapid immune response will prevent virus replication from taking off and spreading to neighboring cells. That means no productive infection, no shedding &amp; spreading, no aberrant host response to infection, &amp; likely no long COVID.
1	As described in @TheAtlantic piece by Dr. @Ryan_Mac_Phd, vaccines are not a magical shield that always prevents a viral infection. They are, however, very effective at rapidly clearing infections before they can take hold. Most breakthrough infections are likely abortive. https://t.co/GLiY0RayYr
1	People are understandably worried about long COVID resulting from asymptomatic breakthrough, and while we still don't know much about this, I haven't seen any data suggesting that occurs. I'd be surprised if it was common.
1	However, all the data so far suggests that symptomatic breakthrough is very rare. Severe breakthrough resulting in hospitalization or death rarer still. The vast majority of COVID-19 deaths in nations with ample vaccine supply are in unvaccinated people:  https://t.co/ihsO37T8Pa
1	The vaccines are very, very effective, but they are not perfectly effective. SARS-CoV-2 infections are expected. A minority of breakthrough infections will be symptomatic COVID-19. A smaller minority of those will be severe. And an even smaller minority of those will be fatal.
1	Lots of anecdotal "fully vaxxed people in the ICU" tweets, so I'll share this excellent piece by Dr. @KatherineJWu.    As more people get vaccinated, we will see more breakthrough, including a small % of serious cases.    This doesn't mean vaccines don't work.  https://t.co/hd8jtWSVZ7

1	@Kappy94 And this is inaccurate. SARS-CoV-2 mutates, but reinfection is rare and most vaccine breakthroughs are mild and self-limiting.
1	@Kappy94 The majority of community transmission is occurring in unvaccinated people. So yes, vaccinations are only one piece, if there’s a large proportion of unvaccinated people, which is the case in many communities.
1	@Kappy94 Vaccination is how we end this long term. Over the last 3 months I’ve repeatedly said that we have a lot to do to get people vaccinated, in the US and abroad.

1	@WesPegden @BallouxFrancois I see now. Very interesting. I'm not aware of great data on relative susceptibility vs infectiousness in children.

1	It’s inevitable that cases will emerge. Schools must encourage students and staff to stay home when sick, ensure testing to promptly identify cases, clusters and outbreaks as they emerge, and conduct contact tracing in combination with isolation and quarantine as needed. 17/
1	Measures that protect students also protect teachers and staff. Data shows that teachers aren’t at greater risk of Covid than other essential workers. Getting vaccinated and having strong safety measures in place will keep risk low. 16/
0	Horrifying to see some states block safety measures, such as masks requirements, in schools. Can’t we agree that we should work together to protect our kids? Masks in schools are a route to the new, safer normal as long as Covid is spreading widely. https://t.co/R4mOiY8HIw 15/

0	For the small number of students and staff with very serious underlying health conditions that suppress immune response or increase vulnerability (e.g. organ transplantation, cystic fibrosis), reasonable accommodations would be...reasonable! 13/
1	All of these safety measures should be implemented: Consistent and correct mask use, increased ventilation of indoor spaces, physical distancing of at least three feet, hand-washing, cleaning of school spaces, quick action to find and stop spread from cases in schools. 12/

0	Schools will open in weeks in the US with the Delta variant spreading rapidly. What does this mean for kids—especially those under 12 who aren’t eligible for vaccination? How can we keep them safe? These are important questions that require practical, thoughtful answers. 1/thread
0	Breakthrough infections aren't failures. They're inevitable with any vaccine. Covid vaccines aren't perfect, but they're astonishingly effective at keeping people out of hospitals and morgues.
0	As Delta spreads rapidly in the US, more cases mean more breakthrough infections. Most will be mild, but some will require hospitalization and, in rare cases, result in death. That's why it's crucial more people get vaccinated to slow spread of the virus. https://t.co/j2HNRyQO3t
0	Vaccines have already saved hundreds of thousands of lives globally and will save many more, but they're not 100%. As we see more cases, we'll see more breakthrough infections. That's expected. Vaccines drastically reduce the risk of hospitalization and death from Covid.
0	We must ramp up vaccination globally while working to fight the misinformation, partisan politics, and polarization that undermines efforts to save lives. It’s humanity against dangerous microbes. Let’s encourage all politicians to get on the right side of that fight.

1	@BeagleForPres Delta is more transmissible so it may lead to more cases in kids. Most have mild/no symptoms when infected but some can develop serious illness or get long Covid (need more data). It's reasonable for vaccinated parents to be more cautious &amp; get tested after known Covid contact.
1	This steep decrease reversed more than 10 years of progress closing the life expectancy gap between Black and white Americans. It's crucial that we invest in public health preparedness and improve health inequities. https://t.co/nLdvqAgA0d
0	@abuttenheim @nichferris Thanks, good point. The larger point tho is that with the combination of vaccinated elders and a much younger average age of patients, the rate of death per infection will be much lower. Thanks!
1	We can reduce the risk of other dangerous variants by vaccinating widely and also tamping down spread. 20/end
1	The more uncontrolled spread, the more risk of even more dangerous variants. Vaccination, masks, ventilation and distancing can stop Covid, including Delta. Variants remain the wild card for the trajectory of the pandemic. Delta may not be the worst strain the virus deals us. 19/
1	Unvaccinated people should be concerned about the rapid rise of Delta, which now makes up at least 83% of sequenced cases in the US. https://t.co/zt95CTsSTP 18/
1	Delta is spreading. How the virus affects you when you encounter it depends on whether your body has been prepared by the vaccine to recognize and fight it—or is caught off guard. 17/
1	The worst is over in the US, but, on average, 200-300 people are still dying every day from a disease that didn't exist 18 months ago. If that rate continues for the next 12 months, that would be 100,000 deaths—more, even, than from the horrific opiate epidemic. 16/
0	When you see headlines claiming a significant proportion of hospitalized patients somewhere are fully vaccinated, don't be alarmed. Most of those stories actually underscore that vaccines are working exceptionally well against variants—including Delta. 15/ https://t.co/PwQKX2Jnpy
0	It's neither necessary nor wise for our public health systems to try to track every single mild breakthrough case. Instead, we should focus on investigating all infections as part of specific population-based studies, and also track all severe Covid illness after vaccination. 14/
1	Sometimes it can be hard to determine whether Covid was the true cause of death in patients receiving palliative care or already very ill, which complicates our understanding of the impact of breakthrough infections in certain groups. https://t.co/dbfNwK60uF 13/
1	We need better data on severe breakthrough infections, but my guess is that they’re more likely to occur in people of advanced age or with serious underlying conditions. It’s possible that the mRNA vaccines are more protective than other vaccines. 12/
1	Unfortunately, some breakthrough infections will be less mild, requiring hospitalization and, in rare cases, resulting in death. That doesn’t change the reality that vaccination is the best way to protect ourselves from Covid. 11/
1	When infections do occur among vaccinated people, the vast majority of these cases are mild. For most, Covid is no more serious than the common cold. They’re also less likely to spread the virus, so people around them are safer, although not completely protected. 10/
1	Vaccines will save tens of thousands of lives but are not 100%. They provide great protection, not perfect protection. More cases → more breakthrough infections. Breakthrough infections are expected, but vaccines drastically reduce risk of hospitalization &amp; death from Covid. 9/
0	In the months ahead, more cases won’t correlate to more deaths in the same way as earlier in the pandemic. This graph from the UK shows why. Age matters—a lot. 8/ https://t.co/a0XU2VfcRe
0	If disease continues to spread, deaths may increase, particularly among adults who are not vaccinated. Because the most vulnerable are vaccinated, the overall increase will be much smaller than past horrific increases. 7/
0	Fewer vulnerable people means fewer deaths. Whereas the infection fatality rate in the US before vaccines was 1 in 200, it could be less than 1 in 500, or as low as 1 in 1,000, in the coming months because of vaccine protection—even if we see many breakthrough infections. 6/
0	Though we’ll likely see big increases in US cases, future waves won’t be as deadly. That’s because 80% of the most vulnerable Americans—people over 65—are fully vaccinated. https://t.co/FjuUoHlRQs 5/
0	But in many places with high rates of vaccination, including much of the US, the worst is over. 4/
	Many countries have so far avoided big surges but haven’t had access to the vaccines needed to vaccinate their populations. Many of these countries will likely see explosive spread of Covid over the coming weeks and months. 3/
1	Globally, we’re far from the end of the pandemic. Delta is at least two times more contagious than the original virus, which means it will infect and kill more people. 2/

1	@pattysullivan It's a good question and not an easy one. The lower the community rate, the lower the risk to kids and all. But there's no evidence that delta causes more severe illness among those it infects - since it infects many more people, more will get ill.

0	The vaccines we're using in the US work very well against Delta, particularly to prevent severe illness and death.
1	We can tame Covid, even the Delta strain. That means working together, vaccinating widely, and following the data so we can adjust our policies and programs to protect people as effectively as possible.
1	Your immune system does well at fighting threats it's seen before. But Covid is new—and its mutations, such as Delta, are even newer. Vaccination prepares your body to fight Covid, so it doesn't have to face a dangerous enemy sight unseen.

1	7/ But many of these athletes who've had breakthrough infections with Delta have had very high levels of virus and carried that virus for longer than was the case with Alpha.

1	4/ COVID vaccines may be enough to keep us all safe once we've controlled SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community, but we're not there yet. The Delta variant is driving a lot more transmission.    We're still on a NASCAR track and need our helmet and airbags (e.g. indoor masking).

0	147/ Do you need EXTRA doses of vaccine to treat long COVID?    We don’t know.
1	146/ In a poll @Survivor_Corps posted to their patient community about the effects of vaccination on long COVID, they found that about 40% of people reported mild to full resolution of their symptoms after they were vaccinated.
0	145/ @Yale's Akiko Iwasaki @VirusesImmunity is leading the way on this research:  https://t.co/Zv5LQBswr2    The idea for the study came from @Survivor_Corps, a grassroots COVID patient group.
1	144/ It’s hypothesized that symptoms of long COVID are the result of   - persistent SARS-CoV-2 replication (perhaps in immunoprivileged sites like the brain)  - viral fragments left over after infection  - autoimmune disease triggered by the infection
1	143/ Is COVID vaccination a treatment for long COVID?     Possibly.
1	142/ The right test is a quantitative, high-sensitivity Spike protein antibody test.    Many COVID antibody tests detect antibodies against nucleocapsid antigen. You will test negative on these tests if you were vaccinated, not infected.
1	141/ If you are in a high-risk group (e.g. solid organ transplant recipient), it may make sense to get tested in consultation with an infectious disease specialist or immunologist. It’s important that the right test be ordered and interpreted correctly.
1	140/ Does it make sense to get tested to see if you’re immune after vaccination?    The FDA recommends against it. This is completely unnecessary for most people.    However...
0	139/ See:  https://t.co/WPGtAAJEHu  https://t.co/ZOBAykJfTb  https://t.co/MjAN9XAa2n  https://t.co/9xE6vokS22  https://t.co/71wAfJg8mm  https://t.co/HF2mQjKHto
1	138/ We’re still studying heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimens.    This is when the 1st dose of a vaccine is one kind (e.g. J&amp;J or AZ) followed by a 2nd type of vaccine (e.g. Pfizer or Moderna). Preliminary data suggests that mix-match regimens may be more potent.
0	137/  - Solid organ transplant recipients and other significantly immunosuppressed persons.
1	136/   - People who received the J&amp;J vaccine, especially elderly persons who mount weaker immune responses to vaccination.  Why? The J&amp;J vaccine offers less robust protection against the Beta &amp; Delta variants.
1	135/ Based on the available data, some exceptions and groups in which I think an additional dose of COVID vaccine might be indicated include:
1	134/   - In making the case for a 3rd dose of its vaccine, Pfizer presented data from ongoing follow-up of phase III study participants to the White House COVID Response Team this week, but this data has yet to be shared publicly.    This data must be shared publicly.
0	133/ How to summarize what this all means?    - We don’t yet have data to support additional or higher doses of COVID vaccine for the general public.
0	132/ See also:   https://t.co/2SvgHDLfdZ
0	131/ In addition to giving additional or higher doses of vaccine to immunosuppressed persons, other options include pausing methotrexate, which has been shown to improve immunogenicity of influenza vaccination:  https://t.co/tUJEphxRh3  https://t.co/IUJlWgFzoN
0	130/ Until the @CDCgov / ACIP &amp;/or @US_FDA / VRBAC offer guidance, it will be difficult for immunosuppressed patients to get a 3rd dose of mRNA vaccine (or a dose of mRNA vaccine after 1st dose of J&amp;J) in the U.S.

0	82/ The data Pfizer shared with the WH COVID Response Team has not yet been shared publicly.  This data is based on Pfizer’s ongoing follow-up of phase III study participants.  https://t.co/8sv2jcS8tV  This data must be made public.
0	81/ Why did Pfizer announce that a 3rd dose of its COVID vaccine might be needed?  https://t.co/w7tPMIpwud
1	80/ Neutralizing antibody titers are significantly lower vs Beta than the early D614G &amp; Alpha variants.    Neutralizing antibody titers were slightly lower vs Delta than the early D614G and Alpha variants.    https://t.co/y2S5VvYltG https://t.co/iMIkxXDJDg
0	79/ Here’s data from France.  This graph shows neutralizing antibody titers 5 weeks after a 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine.  The dotted line represents limits of detection.    https://t.co/y2S5VvYltG https://t.co/ZzAFiKOJJr
1	78/ The neutralizing antibody titers versus Beta &amp; Delta were lower than for early strains &amp; Alpha.  https://t.co/tHB0OYkhog https://t.co/OUysXSJB7H
1	77/ Here’s data from the Legacy Study in the UK.    2 doses of Pfizer elicited protected neutralizing antibody responses (&gt;40) against all variants in almost all participants except 3% with Delta &amp; 5% with Beta.    https://t.co/tHB0OYkhog https://t.co/X7CHeKSFkE
1	76/ While there is a drop in neutralizing antibody activity against Delta as compared with the early WA1/2020 strain, both the Pfizer &amp; Moderna vaccines elicit protective immune responses against both.     https://t.co/SQC9aZXzs5 https://t.co/t1x22ipIp5
1	75/ These are neutralizing antibody titers 35-51 days after people received 2 doses of the Moderna vaccine or 7-27 days after they received 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine.    The horizontal dotted line represents the threshold for protective immunity. https://t.co/lU6Zptp6JQ
0	74/ And now let’s have a look at correlates of immunity/protection, i.e. neutralizing antibody activity elicited by the Pfizer &amp; Moderna vaccines.
0	73/ ...and highly effective against hospitalization related to infection with the Alpha &amp; Delta variants (VE 95% and 96% respectively).    https://t.co/O3RC6ugCkS https://t.co/BPKuoCxE2V
0	72/ Here is data from Public Health England (PHE).     Adjusted for age, co-morbidities, &amp; other related factors, they found that 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine was highly protective vs symptomatic disease from the Alpha &amp; Delta variants (OR 0.06 and 0.12 respectively)... https://t.co/Us3Mx2BqML
1	71/ In this case-control study, two doses of the Pfizer vaccine were 93% effective against the Alpha variant &amp; 88% effective vs the Delta variant.  https://t.co/oymXTjpnpy https://t.co/6W5Ix9aw1Q
0	70/ Here’s real-world evidence of the effectiveness of the Pfizer &amp; AZ vaccines vs the Delta &amp; Alpha variants in the UK.  https://t.co/oymXTjpnpy
0	69/ I’m going to focus on more recent studies of the Pfizer &amp; Moderna vaccine effectiveness, which were conducted after the emergence of the Delta variant.
1	68/ Now let’s turn to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. These are both mRNA vaccines with comparable vaccine effectiveness, so I’ll discuss both together.
1	67/ While the Pfizer &amp; Moderna vaccines retain significant neutralizing antibody activity against the variants of concern 80-90 days after vaccination, the J&amp;J vaccine does not.  https://t.co/ZQEfHMG6Sl https://t.co/NekamkHxay
1	66/ This graph shows neutralizing antibody titers elicited by each vaccine (BNT162b2 = Pfizer, mRNA-1273 = Moderna, Ad26.COV2.S = J&amp;J) against an early strain of the virus (D614G) versus variants of concern. https://t.co/eWbvt2AAnJ
0	65/ Here’s more real-world evidence of the effectiveness of the J&amp;J (&amp; Pfizer &amp; Moderna) vaccine vs the variants.   This is a cohort of healthcare workers at @nyuniversity @nyulangone (i.e. my coworkers).  https://t.co/ZQEfHMG6Sl
0	64/ These data are consistent with ongoing affinity maturation and improved neutralizing activity against variants of concern with time.  https://t.co/nkBp66XMoL https://t.co/r5L3BUi9TX
1	63/ Neutralizing antibody titers to the variants were lower than for the early strains at both 1 months and 8 months after vaccination.  This was most pronounced vs Beta with a reduction of 13x at 1 month &amp; 3x at 8 months versus the early strains.  https://t.co/nkBp66XMoL https://t.co/BQoHR6wovT
1	62/ The horizontal red line represents median neutralizing antibody titers in each group.  https://t.co/nkBp66XMoL https://t.co/C1FHOMClxz
0	61/ The graph on the top shows neutralizing antibody titers a month after vaccination.  The graph on the bottom shows neutralizing antibody titers 8 months after vaccination.  https://t.co/nkBp66XMoL https://t.co/xdmz6tJNUm
0	60/ Here’s another study. J&amp;J was again given as 1- &amp; 2-dose regimens &amp; in low versus high doses.  The x-axis shows strains of SARS-CoV-2: early (WA1/2020, D614G) versus variants of concern (Alpha, Delta, Gamma, Beta).  The y-axis shows neutralizing antibody titers. https://t.co/StzmIXhj4A
1	59/ The median antibody titers 71 days after vaccination were 5x &amp; 3.3x lower for the Beta &amp; Gamma variants than versus early strains.    But though we see a drop, neutralizing antibody titers remain well above the limits of detection. https://t.co/tDPqAAUyDV
1	58/ Note that the FDA authorized the single-dose, low-dose J&amp;J regimen shown here (the filled triangles).    The horizontal bars represent the median neutralizing antibody response against each variant. https://t.co/B9oia1AxYc
1	57/ Now let’s look at correlates of immunity/protection for the J&amp;J COVID vaccine versus the variants.  This is data from a Phase I-IIA trial of the J&amp;J vaccine given in one- and two-dose schedules and low-dose vs high-dose.  https://t.co/cnBn6hpYbJ
0	56/ Phase III ENSEMBLE trial of J&amp;J vaccine  https://t.co/RLE8gbNbv3  Brazil: 70% of COVID during the study was due to the P.2 variant  South Africa: 95% of COVID during the study was due to the Beta variant. https://t.co/xyhBab3e8G
0	55/ Remember that Phase III clinical trials of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were conducted PRIOR to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants.    The J&amp;J vaccine had lower vaccine efficacy in Brazil and South Africa where variants of concern (VOC) had emerged.
0	54/ The Phase III Ensemble Study of the J&amp;J vaccine provided us with an early signal that the immune response to vaccination could potentially be evaded by variants.  https://t.co/RLE8gbNbv3
1	53/ And this is where the SARS-CoV-2 variants come in.    Even if an immune response after vaccination is DURABLE, it may not be STRONG or TARGETED enough against new, emerging variants.
1	52/ As explained above, the need to tweak vaccine dosing regimens depends on whether you need more doses  - to extend the DURATION of an immune response  OR  - to overcome IMMUNE-EVASION (i.e. a mutating, evolving pathogen).
0	51/  - How do age &amp; immunosuppression impact on the duration &amp; robustness of your immune response?  https://t.co/cVmU72N2xG
0	50/  - And is rate of decay predicted by initial neutralizing antibody titer?  - Does your initial neutralizing antibody titer predict the robustness and durability of your bone marrow plasma cell and memory B-cell responses?
0	49/ Other Qs remain unanswered, too:  - We don’t know how neutralizing antibody titers will decline over time for people who got infected vs people who were vaccinated.  - Is rate of decay different for naturally infected vs vaccinated persons?
0	48/ When might our immune responses—antibody, long-lived plasma cells in bone marrow, and memory B-cell responses—wane enough that we might need additional doses of COVID vaccine?
1	47/ If you’re also protected by long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow and memory B-cell responses, should we be looking at those, too?    Or are neutralizing antibody levels soon after infection/vaccination a good enough surrogate?    We're not sure.
1	46/ Even though antibody levels may wane over time, long-lived plasma cells in bone marrow &amp; memory B-cells still provide protection.  https://t.co/Apu7kp0qKE
0	45/ This graph shows what’s happening in the germinal centers (GC) in lymph nodes (LN) after vaccination.  Memory B-cells &amp; plasma cells in the lymph nodes continue to mature &amp; strengthen. https://t.co/qEpGje7EoP
0	44/ In both cases, antibody titers peak about 4 weeks after the second dose of Pfizer vaccine &amp; then decline.  https://t.co/Apu7kp0qKE  This is what we EXPECT to happen as per #19 above.
0	43/ This graph shows what happens to antibody responses after 2 doses of Pfizer vaccine.  In red are people who didn’t get COVID before getting vaccinated.  In black are people who had COVID before getting vaccinated. https://t.co/CQyHHRDXYK
0	42/ So what are our best correlates of immunity/protection vs SARS-CoV-2?    Early? Neutralizing antibody titers?    Later? Neutralizing antibody titers and/or long-lived plasma cells in bone marrow &amp; memory B-cells?
0	41/ Where the T-cell response is deficient or absent, the innate immune response might continue (cytokine storm) &amp; cause the hyperinflammatory state seen in patients with severe COVID.  https://t.co/aNcLBrBmLi  https://t.co/fsQi8kGGGl
1	40/ And what about T-cells?    CD4+ T cells are most strongly associated with lessened COVID disease severity.  T cell responses may be important for faster viral clearance and tissue repair.
0	39/ The innate immune response also primes adaptive immune responses, like B- and T-cell responses.  https://t.co/DwDJKz576f  https://t.co/aNcLBrBmLi  https://t.co/UjNVJ8uFfh
1	38/ What about the innate immune response?    SARS-CoV-2 is very good at suppressing the innate immune response by preventing, for example, the release of type 1 interferons.    The innate immune response controls viral replication in the respiratory tract and lungs.
1	37/ It's important that we identify good correlates of immunity/protection.    We won't be able to conduct randomized, controlled trials of every vaccine dose/regimen/combo vs every new mutant variant.
0	36/   - Or do lower neutralizing antibody titers measured years later correlate with waning vaccine effectiveness?
0	35/   - Can we think of the initial peak neutralizing antibody titer as a setpoint of sorts?  - Are neutralizing antibody titers analogous prognostic value to CD4+ T-cell count nadirs &amp; HIV viral load peaks in patients with HIV?
0	34/ How we define correlates of protection/immunity matters. It’s not just WHAT, but what WHEN.    - Do neutralizing antibody titers measured soon after infection or vaccination predict vaccine effectiveness over the long term?
1	33/ In fact, memory B-cell responses continue to increase over many months after SARS-CoV-2 infection with progressive increases in somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation during that time.
1	32/ If neutralizing antibody titers drop after infection or vaccination, does that mean you’re no longer immune?     No. You’re still protected by long-lived plasma cells in your bone marrow and memory B-cells. https://t.co/BZ40X4H4U4
0	31/ Memory B-cells can proliferate &amp; differentiate far more quickly than naïve B-cells, so the secondary immune response is faster and stronger (notice that the second pink curve of antibodies has a steeper slope and higher peak). https://t.co/NpaAVAQgG9
0	30/ Long-lived memory B-cells do not secrete antibodies, but they survive for prolonged periods.    When they are rechallenged with an infectious pathogen, they proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells. These plasma cells then make antibody. https://t.co/XbuCnpuGHn
0	29/ Memory B-cells are also generated during the germinal center reaction and can rapidly respond to rechallenge.    Some memory B-cells remain in the lymphoid organs where they were generated, while others exit and recirculate between the blood and lymphoid organs. https://t.co/89LaHPYWum
1	28/ Long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow secrete antibodies that provide immediate protection upon rechallenge.    About half of the antibodies in the blood of a healthy adult are produced by long-lived plasma cells. https://t.co/xgoPxrIWgi
1	27/ It takes ~2-3 weeks after vaccination before the bone marrow becomes a major site of antibody production.    Long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow may continue to secrete antibodies for decades after infection/vaccination. https://t.co/eUBdrCGCmg
1	26/ In the germinal centers, some of these B-cells become plasmablasts (precursors to plasma cells), migrate to the bone marrow, and differentiate into LONG-LIVED PLASMA CELLS. https://t.co/2xoDofNLM1
1	25/ While the amount of antibody produced decreases over time, the quality of these antibodies increases.    Neutralizing antibody titers reflect both quantity &amp; quality.
1	24/ Through a process called SOMATIC HYPERMUTATION, activated B-cells undergo AFFINITY MATURATION, getting better and better at recognizing the antigen. https://t.co/isjYNB3b4E
0	23/ But the immune response doesn’t stop there.  B-cells &amp; T-cells in the lymph nodes, spleen, &amp; other secondary lymphoid organs form GERMINAL CENTERS, which is like a finishing school for immune cells. https://t.co/MDsBRt8hV4

Not sure if this takes the delta variant into account because this was from a few weeks ago. But, nearly 100% of COVID deaths and ICU admissions are now in the unvaccinated.

1	@SiddhantTomar10 Sorry for your loss. Could be that he contacted virus at vaccination centre. The ability to fight the infection is affected by level of immunity &amp; past medical history so every1 has different response to vaccine. Do take the vaccine but wear PPE kit, mask, shield in the centre.

1	@sushantsareen 3 possible reasons- 1. Virus mutations. Every time the virus mutates, it will mutate towards path of least resistance. So after the older generation it is shifting to middle aged ones and sooner might effect children.  2. Carelessness in taking precautions. 3. Delay in treatment

1	8) What could come next? The @CDCgov doesn’t seem to really know. Their 26 different projection models are all over the place. @ScottGottliebMD is right that the “CDC doesn’t know how to model this wave” of #DeltaVariant. https://t.co/4l4MgUfr9D
1	26) This is not good. Even under rosy optimistic scenarios, containing #DeltaVariant was already hard. But it’s not easy…. see details 🧵 https://t.co/PjI6j5WdkT
0	@ddiamond Sounds like mothership.
1	7) if we allow the virus to keep spreading, keep mutating, keep adapting to our bodies, and if someday a new variant arises that is R0=12… then we might be toast… it’s in the epidemiology math. https://t.co/Li2U5XAw4l
1	6) the longer we wait, the more we might see this VE waning… the trend is very significant. Vaccines are excellent and please vaccinate to protect yourself but we need more than just vaccines alone to contain #DeltaVariant total spread. That’s the truth. https://t.co/MAOWVJ4Vu2
1	5) The worry is that an R0=8 could mean #DeltaVariant keeps spiraling out of control… and we get a mass infection burn through like India 🇮🇳 had with its #DeltaVariant surge. We absolutely don’t want this hell-ish scenario. We need fast action! It’s not too late @CDCDirector https://t.co/M1HIaLdBJj
1	4) Vaccine efficacy is much lower now in Israel 🇮🇱 than before as #DeltaVariant prevalence rises and case load rises (greater spread) and as protection potentially wanes over time. See detailed thread 🧵 https://t.co/S5IcRNuYGJ
1	3) the upper estimate for the R0 for #DeltaVariant is ~8, but this means that with realistic 60% vaccine efficacy and 64% fully vaxxed (very few countries have that), and excellent compliance with PH measures like masks &amp; no indoor gatherings (that’s a stretch), its not enough!!! https://t.co/rOX2PAzRPs
1	2) the truth is, the best case scenario of 70% fully #vaccinated and vaccine efficacy of 99% for total infection and R0=6 is somewhat of a fairytale for the near future. Vaccinations have stalled. And efficacy is likely &lt;70%, maybe even 40%. HT @GosiaGasperoPhD https://t.co/JVxJhzfZtf
1	📍NEAR VERTICAL—The South is now seeing #DeltaVariant in its true vertical exponential form. So many not vaxxed. Short of lockdowns, it now all comes down to masks, ventilation &amp; air disinfection—but if Delta has R0=6, it’s hard to bend curve; if R0=8, it’s almost impossible.🧵 https://t.co/73PpjRxcuH

1	18) also if we look at just the elderly age 60+ (stratification is one form of adjustment in epidemiology), we still see the jump up among the January vaccinated even among these elderly. This implies this is an effect by time (stratified adjusted roughly for age), not just age. https://t.co/Z6EoPiYRjj
1	17) Some others say “oh it’s a smaller dataset than UK”—yeah but it’s still VERY significant. Notice how the 95% confidence intervals’ lower bounds all exclude zero—and by comfortable cushion of certainly. And the 40% VE’s upper bound excludes 88% from 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 data. So these are diff. https://t.co/PQ3iH8I4Ub
1	16) another debate is that early vaccinations “reflect time that has passed since vaccination, but also… often people with health conditions and who are more prone to infection, such as the elderly.” We discussed this above—but again age isn’t explaining this—60+ &amp; &lt;60 similar. https://t.co/BXS9hy3AGQ
1	15) Thus to rephrase—if unvaccinated are tested more than vaccinated, then we would fine more of the milder / asymptomatic infections in unvaccinated relatively, and that would make the vaccine efficacy look relatively higher, not lower. So that is unlikely to explain the VE dip.
1	14) there is some debate about the new 🇮🇱 ~40% efficacy data. Some say unvaccinated are tested more—true, but in that case, then we’d find relatively more cases in the unvaccinated, which would make the vaccine efficacy look BETTER, not worse (seen here).  https://t.co/3SbOzYGQEP
1	13) “Dr. Amanda Cohn, the chief medical officer of CDC immunizations division, told an advisory committee to the agency that officials were “actively looking into ways” to provide certain people access to booster shots “earlier than any potential change in regulatory decisions.”
1	12) “On Thursday, a key official at @CDCgov said the agency is exploring options to give patients with compromised immune systems third doses even before regulators broaden the emergency use authorization for coronavirus vaccines, a step that could come soon for Pfizer vaccine.
1	11) “That is a sharp shift from just a few weeks ago, when the administration said it thought there was not enough evidence to back boosters yet.
1	10) “Senior officials now say they expect that people who are 65 and older or who have compromised immune systems will most likely need a third shot from Pfizer or Moderna.”

Not sure… if you look at breakthrough rate in age 60+ versus 16-59, the 16-59 have similar if not higher breakthrough rate if comparing Jan vs Jan, Feb vs Feb of same month!

0	Yes, should be before injection- been a hard day!!! Thanks for catching. https://t.co/tA3p9CeZyA
1	Yes, there is a chance you can transmit the virus- but will be much less than if you weren't vaccinated https://t.co/DrncHA0fLY
1	You should not get a Covid vaccine if you are symptomatic with the virus, but will not test for asymptomatic infection before testing. https://t.co/qM2fABKAxV

	Well said, @PowerUSAID. Each delivery is a “beacon of hope” and a step forward in the global fight to end the pandemic. https://t.co/SdrqWaw3uC
1	Vaccines have had an incredible impact throughout history. Dr Fauci’s stark assertion that we wouldn’t have eradicated smallpox with the current level of misinformation must be heeded in the fight against #COVID19. #VaccinesWork https://t.co/zDPIv1dfgq
1	Data suggests 4 in 5 people in low- and middle-income countries are willing to get vaccinated against #COVID19. Let’s make the most of these high levels of acceptance by prioritizing LMICs to boost global immunity while working to increase demand: https://t.co/dMuzWjYV43

1	“Dose donations are proving to be a good medicine for vaccine nationalism” - agree with @UNICEFSupply’s Gian Gandhi. Countries that commit to #sharedosesnow make a stand for vaccine equity and help protect the world’s most vulnerable: https://t.co/eqZD7IRxKV
1	The PCV vaccine is one of our best weapons against the single biggest killer of children under 5. Reducing the incidence of severe pneumococcal pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis in children in The Gambia by 80% is incredible proof that #VaccinesWork! #LeaveNoOneBehind https://t.co/QrmwOpvWBw

1	The sooner countries share #COVID19 vaccines the better. COVAX needs doses now, while its supplies are low &amp; when countries have the ability to deliver them. It would be a tragedy to get them too late, when there are millions of people in desperate need: https://t.co/5BXurjuxom
1	As @AureliaFNguyen notes, from September onwards, the #COVAX supply forecast projects that about 400 million #COVID19 vaccine doses will become available every month. This is an important acceleration, but we must be mindful of capacity.
1	Absorptive capacity is a real concern for #COVAX as, if countries wait to share or donate doses later in the year, there is a risk of health systems becoming too stretched by the volume of deliveries. The only way to avoid that is to #sharedosesnow: https://t.co/zGhQ2wCjTM

1	We need to invest in additional manufacturing capacity in the Global South to prepare for future outbreaks. With #COVAX we have a model for a powerful and effective mechanism that is hindered by supply issues. This vision could help shape our global pandemic response strategy.
1	The African continent currently imports 99% of its vaccines. To prepare for the next pandemic we must increase global supply and globalize it. @AfricaCDC and @_AfricanUnion’s commitment to boost manufacturing capacity &amp; reshape the market is critical for pandemic preparedness.
1	The #COVID19 pandemic has further exposed the challenges of vaccine nationalism, and the need to expand manufacturing in the Global South. Great interview with @AfricaCDC Director @JNkengasong on how Africa can manufacture more of its own vaccines: https://t.co/J4anW16j8p

1	Alarming numbers: 23m children missed out on basic, routine vaccinations in 2020 – 3.7m more than 2019. After decades of progress improving access to immunisation, #COVID19 risks reversing these hard-won gains. https://t.co/7M5gkKN1rm

0	The @Gavi #COVAX AMC needs an additional $2 billion to boost #COVID19 vaccine coverage in AMC countries up to nearly 30%. That funding is urgently needed by June 2 to lock in supplies now so that doses can be delivered through 2021 and into early 2022: https://t.co/akF75L4QDc
0	Exactly right @MSuzman. Investments in #COVAX quickly pay for themselves because vaccines have a tremendous return on investment and generate major benefits well into the future: https://t.co/G3btt2MxU8
1	Frontline workers put themselves at risk to protect others. Let #COVAX deliver to keep them safe. https://t.co/0zIa2ek5zQ
1	The fastest and fairest way to end the acute phase of the pandemic is through vaccine equity. As @daktari1 rightly says, we cannot afford to risk prolonging the pandemic a day longer: https://t.co/d1nihEq8oq
1	A fully-funded @Gavi #COVAX AMC would reduce the economic impact of #COVID19, mitigate the risk of new variants, protect heroic frontline health workers and provide a fair, equitable route out of this pandemic. Join us on June 2 as we mobilise funds to ensure #OneWorldProtected https://t.co/1jH9opbh3k
1	Vaccines are better at preventing outbreaks than containing them: this is why we need to protect as many people as possible, starting with Hlth workers &amp; the vulnerable, before further surges hit. Read @doctorsoumya, @DrRHatchett &amp; I in @nytimes: https://t.co/jnLimOjngz
0	Now more than ever, at the peak of the pandemic, we need to fund the @Gavi COVAX AMC, share doses and free up supply chains. We can meet the supply challenges with concerted action and global leadership. @CEPIvaccines @UNICEF @WHO
1	#COVAX’s key goal of delivering 2 billion doses #COVID19 vaccines worldwide in 2021, and 1.8 billion doses to 92 lower-income economies by early 2022, is within reach but only if world leaders come together to ensure #vaccinequity: https://t.co/akF75L4QDc

0	Committing to support #COVAX also means committing to mitigate the risk of potentially more dangerous #COVID19 variants. This is in everyone’s best interest. #IPU142 https://t.co/6OLLtj8ZkQ
0	The #COVID19 pandemic has cost the global economy $ 11.5 trillion, pushed an additional 163 million people into poverty and disrupted progress towards the #SDGs. We can and must be better prepared for future pandemics.
0	Rebuilding, safeguarding and strengthening routine immunization is also vital to avoid reversing decades of progress and to strengthen health systems for better pandemic preparedness. Reaching #ZeroDoseChildren is critical for global health security.
1	This #WHA74 @Gavi is calling for Member States to mobilize funding, share #COVID19 doses with #COVAX, support technology transfer and remove export control measures because equity must be at the heart of the pandemic response: https://t.co/6C2m6anhTN
